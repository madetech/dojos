# [Anagrams Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/) (Ruby/TDD)

[wordlist.txt](wordlist.txt) contains 338,882 words, and the goal of this dojo is to find all of the words within it that are anagrams of each other and group them together.

As an example, these would be considered anagram groups:

* kinship pinkish
* enlist inlets listen silent
* boaster boaters borates
* fresher refresh
* sinks skins
* knits stink
* rots sort

We should find there are 20,683 anagram groups.
